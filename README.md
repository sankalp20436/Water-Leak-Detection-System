# Water-Leak-Detection-System

Automated  water leakage detection systems can help the different sectors of the world a lot by saving water wastage. This project is an attempt to illustrate implementation of water leakage detection and monitoring system using the applications of Internet of Things (IoT)

## Features
* developed a prototype to detect Water leak
*  IoT based solution to monitor the consumption of water and volume of waster wasted.

## Proposed Methodology:
* The proposed system uses Two Sensor nodes each consisting of water flow rate sensor (YFS201), Arduino uno and ESP8266 deployed at two different positions on the pipe. The sensors are attached to an Arduino which is connected to the Wi-Fi module ESP8266.
* The data acquired is sent through the Wi-Fi to the Thing speak cloud where it is analysed. The data will be analysed by using simple algorithms to detect a leak. It detects the leak by calculating the difference in data of water flow rates acquired from the sensors deployed at different positions. If the difference is greater than the set threshold, an alert signal is sent to the user. User can view the data regarding the total volume of water consumed and the volume of water leaked through the pipes. In this project The Water flow rate is measured in terms of Lit/Hr.
